### Foreword
The application has enough bugs to make you sick in about a minute, if not even less. Before judging, see the contributions graph: it's mostly due to the fact we were short on time and didn't really plan things well enough.

### Installation
Requirements:

- [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download) (please mind you need one for 2.7, not 3+)
- To install vkontakte API wrapper, do as follows:
 - Install [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/), Python package manager
 - Install `vkontakte` via it

Note: now that there's a `py3-port` branch, you may want to use it. In this case you'll need Python 3 (you don't say), PyQt5 and `vk` instead of `vkontakte`.
### Usage
```
python MainWindow.py
```
